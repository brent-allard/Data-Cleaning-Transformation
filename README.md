## Introduction

Data cleaning and transformation involve various processes to improve the quality and usability of datasets. Cleaning refers to the identification and handling of errors, inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers in the data. Transformation, on the other hand, involves modifying the data's structure or format to meet specific requirements.

This repository aims to provide an overview of data cleaning and transformation techniques, along with code examples, tutorials, and resources to help you effectively preprocess your data.

## Why Data Cleaning and Transformation?

Data is rarely in its ideal state for analysis or modeling. Real-world datasets often contain missing values, duplicate entries, inconsistent formatting, or outliers that can negatively impact the accuracy and reliability of any downstream analysis. Data cleaning and transformation help address these issues, enabling you to:

- Enhance data quality and accuracy
- Ensure consistency across the dataset
- Handle missing or invalid values
- Remove duplicates
- Standardize data formats
- Detect and handle outliers
- Prepare data for analysis, visualization, or machine learning tasks

By performing these preprocessing steps, you can maximize the value and insights gained from your data.

## Getting Started

To get started with data cleaning and transformation, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the project's documentation.
3. Explore the code examples, tutorials, and resources provided in the repository to gain a better understanding of different techniques.
4. Use the code snippets and templates as a starting point for your own data cleaning and transformation tasks.
5. Customize and adapt the examples to suit your specific dataset and requirements.
6. Experiment with different techniques and evaluate their impact on your data quality and analysis results.

## Data Cleaning Techniques

This section covers common data cleaning techniques you can apply to your datasets. Some of the techniques you'll find here include:

- Handling missing data
- Removing duplicate entries
- Dealing with inconsistent data formats
- Resolving inconsistent or conflicting values
- Handling outliers
- Addressing data normalization and standardization

Refer to the code examples and tutorials in the repository for detailed instructions on implementing these techniques.

## Data Transformation Techniques

Data transformation involves modifying the structure or format of the data to make it more suitable for analysis or modeling. Some common data transformation techniques include:

- Feature scaling and normalization
- Encoding categorical variables
- Handling datetime data
- Extracting and creating new features
- Aggregating and summarizing data
- Applying mathematical or statistical transformations

Explore the code examples and tutorials provided to learn how to apply these techniques effectively.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory in this repository contains practical code examples that demonstrate various data cleaning and transformation tasks. Each example comes with detailed explanations and instructions to help you understand and adapt the code to your own datasets.

Here are a few examples you'll find in this repository:

1. Cleaning missing data using different imputation techniques.
2. Removing duplicate records from a dataset.
3. Standardizing and normalizing numerical features.
4. Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
5. Handling date and time data
